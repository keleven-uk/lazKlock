/*******************************************************************************************************/

Looks like I have messed up and corrupted the sources somewhere along the line.
It would compile but would error when loading with Access Violation.
What ever I did, I could not see what I had done wrong. The happened at both 32 & 64 bit.
It did happen at the same time as I had tried a new couple of components, maybe I had
mixed up the 32 and 64 bit things.  Or, more probably, trying to access an object
that had not been initialised.  I gave up.

Lazarus then released the final V1.8 - So I decided to try and fix it.

The first build that would compile and run was build 41.  So branch V2.1 starts for there.

I will try apply the changes gradually and see if I can spot the erorr[s].

Date:   Sat Dec 16 18:56:37 2017 +0000


[This is a part duplication of build 45 - mainly the options stuff.]
Added the ability for Klock to write Info and Debug information to log files.
Logging can be enabled / disabled by a user options.  Also the ability to delete
log files older then a certain age.  This is also specified by user options.

An extra tab was added to the options form for the logging options, the log files are also displayed here.

Added a new unit, uLogging.pas.  The unit contains the helper routines to read and delete log files.

Started to sprinkle debug entries all over.

I started to get the Access Violation again, especially in the 32 bit application.
This seemed to be either the logging not being thread safe and a problem in loading
the fonts.  I changed the method that loads the fonts and stopped using TEvent and
wrote a simple logging class of my own that just appends to a text file.
[The logging class resides in uLogging.pas]

All seems to be okay.

Added a routine that retrieves the version of Windows, this is displayed in the
About form and the header of the log file.

Also removed the option to install the sources from the inno installer, they can download them from GitHub.

Changes to history.txt and lazKlock.smproj hanging over from last commit.

Also, did some git admin.  Since the master branch was corrupt and all the recent
work had been done in branch V2.1, it was time to clean up.  This was achieved
with the following.

  git branch -m master master-old 	  # rename master on local
  git push -f origin :master       		# delete master on remote
  git push origin master-old      		# create master-old on remote
  git checkout -b master V2.1      	  # create a new local master on top of V2.1
  git push origin master           		# create master on remote

I now have a current and good master and a working copy at V2.1.

I also deleted branches v1 and v2.  I will delete branches master-old and v2.1
when happy is all is okay.

This also becomes V2.2 and will create a working branch of v2.

Made the xml [options] reading routines more robust.
If an entry is missing, the default values for that entry is
now used instead of an error being generated.
This then cures the problem of new options being added, up to
now if the old options file was not deleted and error was generated.

Also, removed uOptinsUtils and moved the helper routines into
the main options class.

The uStickNote holds the info for one stick Note and uStickyNotes handles creation and

Added a memo tab, this will allow memo's to be entered, edited, printed and
saved.  Any previously saved memos will be loaded into Klock on startup.
The memos can be optionally encrypted and only be displayed on demand.

This added two new files - uMemos.pas and uMemo.pas.
The memo workflow is modeled on the Sticky Note workflow.

Completed the Edit and Encryption bit.
They look to be working - but need further testing.
Still got print to go.

In build 65 I added in "CloseAction := caFree;" to every form, I read this was a
good idea.  This seems to make Klock crash if that form is opened more then
once in any session.  So, I removed it from every form.

Author: Kevin Scott <github@keleven.co.uk>

Tidied up the font handling.  The font work flow needed three entries - one for the file name, one for the name to load the font and a third friendly version for the drop down menus.  All three where hard coded.

This has been changed so that the font directory is scanned and all .ttf files are loaded.  This directory now contains two text files that contain the name to load the font [fontNames.txt] and a list of friendly names [fontTypes.txt].  These text files need to be amended when a new font is added.  But, this means a new font can be added without re-compiling Klock.

Added the option to include the font directory to the archive.

I found the forms properties FormStyle which can be set to fsSystemStayOnTop.
Amended the five other Klock [Analogue Klock, LED Klock, Floating Text Klock, Binary Klock and Small Text Klock] to be able to stay on top, this can be either selected from each Klocks pop up menu or set in the user options.

I think Floating text Klock in Gushing Meadow font in red with stay on top enabled looks cool.


Added a splash screen to Klock [formSplashScreen].
This is called when the program starts and closes.  The splash screen just echo entries being made to the log file.  This is useful if a few fonts are being loaded as this slows down both starting and closing Klock.

Started experiencing a system crash sometimes when Klock loaded.  I think this was caused by the logging unit writing to the splash screen,  Changed the way this was done - will monitor.  This seemed more pronounced in the 32 bit version.

Tidied up some of the classes, introduced destructor routines to clear memory objects.

Also, on the other Klocks, set timer enable to false on form create and form close and time enable to true on form show.

Noticed that there was a flicker when displaying Floating text Klock.  So, amended the update time thingy so it only updated the display when the text changed and not every second.  This makes a difference when displaying fuzzyTime that changes every five minutes.  Also made this change to the main Klock, to save resources.

Added an option verbose to FuzzyTime so it could add "nearly" and "just gone" to the output.

General code tidy up and correcting spelling errors.

Merged master and V2.

Author: Kevin Scott <github@keleven.co.uk>
Date:   Sat Mar 17 20:03:13 2018 +0000

Added the ability for Klock to keep a Monitor Awake, i.e. stop the system sending the display monitor to sleep.
Klock can used to methods to achieve this.
Klock can simulate the pressing of <CTRL F15>.  This is recognised my the OS, but does not appear on most keyboards so therefore is nut used by many programs.  If this does cause problems, the second method can be used.
Klock can jiggle the mouse, the mouse is moved on pixel and moved back again.
The time interval for this can also be set, this should be just under the system time out.

This is configured with new user options.

Simplified the logic for the idle timer.  This routine now checks whether to keep the monitor awake or not.

Updated tzdata to latest version [2018d].

Implemented a simple Biorhythm chart, the start date is held in the user
options.  The chart is called via a menu option of the main Klock form.

Tidied up some code in uInfoutils.pas, so that the returned stringLists are
correctly handled - closed when not needed

The about, and Licence, Info forms are now created when needed and not at the start of the app.
Trying to do the same with the time forms - but the ones with transparency seem a problem.
Simplified the calling of the info forms.

More changes to Power stuff when running on a lap top.  It now shows more meaningful times for 
battery use, but not quite the same as is shown in the windows system tray.

More code made to look pretty.

The current Reminder tab had a couple [many] bugs and did not really work and
needed re-writing really.  Also the naming of the Reminder and Event tabs was
not really correct.

So, I have deleted the Reminder tab and all associated code.
I have renamed the Events tab to Reminder - This tab is about a single one off
prompt at a given time so suits the name Reminder and not Events.

A new Events tab will be written, hopefully more suited to the job.

before the event, the user will be reminded.  There should be three such
intervals and will be user defined - but are hard coded at the moment.

model.  This change in the main Klock file was not mirrored into
formFloatingForm.  This caused a application crash if the about form was

The extra Klock where auto created and displayed with the showmodel command,
changed this so that the klocks are only created when wanted and disposed off
when the form is closed.  This saves about 500Kb from the memory footprint of
the running application, but saves over two seconds on initial loading.

Build 111 [2.6.0.111]

Their was problem with the options screen, it crashed klock if it was open
twice.  This was cased by the command CloseAction := caFree; in the form close
routine.  It seems using the showmodel command on a auto generated form does
not like this command.  Amended the options screen to be created when needed
and not auto-generated - all now okay.
The new options screen loads slightly slower, but klocks memory footprint in
reduced by over 1mB now.

Their was a problem with the user option - use custom fonts.  If this was
toggled when klock was running, the font object had to be either created or
destroyed at run time.  Added code to achieve this.

Corrected a bug on the creation of the events file.
