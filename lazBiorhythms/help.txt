lazBiorhythms

A Lazarus program to draw Biorhythms.

The Biorhythms for one or two people can be drawn, just click on the appropriate user.

Once a Birth date has been entered, the total number of days alive will be displayed.

The following rhythms can be displayed - 

Primary
	Physical, with a period of 23 days
	Emotional, with a period of 28 days
	Intellectual, with a period of 33 days

Secondary
	Spiritual, with a period of 53 days
	Awareness, with a period of 48 days
	Aesthetic, with a period of 43 days
	Intuition, with a period of 38 days

Both the Primary and Secondary can be combined into one plot, as can all seven rhythms.

The colours of all the plots can be customised, go to file / options.

Once Birth dates have been entered and change of colours, will be remembered and used next time.
